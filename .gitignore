# Ignore compiled executables (named manually)
# This ignores all files without an extension
# So your .cpp files are safe

# Common binary patterns
*.out
*.exe
*.o
*.so

# Executables with no extension (like 'myprogram')
# This line ignores any file with no extension
*

# But allow specific file types (like .cpp, .h, .md, etc.)
!*.cpp
!*.h
!*.hpp
!*.md
!.gitignore
